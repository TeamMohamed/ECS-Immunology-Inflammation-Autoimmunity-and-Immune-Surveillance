## 🔬 Overview

This white paper presents a clinically deployable and research-integrated immune recalibration framework centered on the Endocannabinoid System (ECS). It outlines how CB2, TRPV1, PPARγ, FAAH, and MAGL regulate inflammation, autoimmunity, immune checkpoints, and post-infection immune exhaustion.

Built from proprietary datasets and AI-augmented therapeutic mapping, this work repositions the ECS as a primary immune logic interface—no longer auxiliary, but central to immune system precision control.

### 📌 Key Sections Include:

- CB2 signalling across innate and adaptive immune lineages
- ECS-mediated suppression of NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines
- Autoantibody and checkpoint modulation
- Post-viral immune exhaustion repair
- ECS-based therapeutic stack matrix with clinical guidance
- Immune surveillance and tolerance preservation
